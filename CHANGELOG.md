# @nredd/pi-plan-mode

## 0.58.0-nredd.4

### Changed

- Kept the transcript scrollable after plan completion by leaving the ready-plan
  action menu closed until the user runs `/plan`. The compact `plan ready`
  footer and one-line widget remain visible while review is pending.

## 0.58.0-nredd.3

### Changed

- Removed the above-editor widget for the "implementing" state (`Implementing
  plan — /plan to show, replace, or clear`) -- redundant with the
  `plan implementing` footer status chip added in 0.58.0-nredd.2
  (`presentation.ts`).
- `plan ready` and `plan saved` are unaffected and keep their one-line widget.

## 0.58.0-nredd.2

### Changed

- Removed the above-editor widget entirely for plain "planning" state (Plan
  mode on, no plan ready yet). The footer status chip (`plan active`) is now
  colored with the theme's `accent` role, Codex-style, instead of plain text
  (`presentation.ts`).
- States with a concrete pending action (`plan ready`, `plan saved`,
  `plan implementing`) are unaffected and keep their one-line widget.

## 0.58.0-nredd.1

Fork of `@narumitw/pi-plan-mode` 0.58.0, extracted to a standalone repo.

### Changed

- Shrank the always-on Plan-mode widget to one line instead of a three-line
  tool-policy dump (`presentation.ts`).
- Added `renderResult` to the `plan_mode_question` tool so answers render as
  Markdown instead of a raw JSON dump, matching `plan_mode_complete`
  (`question-tool.ts`, `plan-mode.ts`).

# @narumitw/pi-plan-mode

## 0.58.0

### Minor Changes

- b745330: Add persistent fresh implementation model and thinking defaults with a same-as-plan fallback.
- 0ef037d: Add one-shot model and thinking selection before fresh ready-plan implementation.

### Patch Changes

- 7c9a062: Defer automatic ready-plan fresh session handoffs until lifecycle dispatch and prompt cleanup finish.
- Updated dependencies [4485b49]
- Updated dependencies [6b1e009]
  - @narumitw/pi-tui-kit@0.62.0

## 0.57.1

### Patch Changes

- 31b3dde: Remove the implementation model and thinking selectors, restoring Plan implementation handoffs to the current model and normal thinking behavior.

## 0.57.0

### Minor Changes

- e2af16b: Add optional implementation model and thinking defaults plus per-menu implementation options for same-session and fresh-session handoffs. Apply choices only at implementation start without changing Pi defaults or automatically restoring the planner's model after a run ends.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [317f7bd]
  - @narumitw/pi-tui-kit@0.61.0

## 0.56.0

### Minor Changes

- e230348: Allow narrowly validated local `hostname`, `tasklist`, `Get-Process`, and `Get-Service` inspections in Plan mode by default.
- 708cc2e: Let users add arbitrary `safeSubcommands` entries and treat every configured command-subcommand prefix as fully trusted for Plan-mode Bash and PowerShell calls.

## 0.55.3

### Patch Changes

- 14068d2: Allow reviewed Git inspections to use current-working-directory `git -C <path>` forms, and report actionable reasons when Plan mode denies an unavailable, inactive, frozen, blocked, or unselected tool.

## 0.55.2

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [40182e5]
  - @narumitw/pi-tui-kit@0.59.0

## 0.55.1

### Patch Changes

- b99b3db: Resolve explicitly selected tools registered before the first Plan request without mutating Pi's active tool schemas.

## 0.55.0

### Minor Changes

- b59cdbc: Remove the `toolVisibility` setting and keep Plan helper schemas stable from startup.
  Retired settings keys are ignored and preserved, while globally visible helper metadata now distinguishes `/plan` from ordinary planning workflows.

## 0.54.0

### Minor Changes

- ab467e0: Allow Pi's active native PowerShell tool to run reviewed read-only file, directory, Git, and GitHub inspections in Plan mode while blocking mutation and unsupported dynamic syntax.

## 0.53.1

### Patch Changes

- 02878f5: Add an editor-style divider above the Plan mode widget.
- 3346683: Publish generated lazy chunks at the JavaScript paths referenced by each extension runtime so deferred menus and implementations load correctly through Pi's Jiti loader.
- Updated dependencies [b9eba3a]
  - @narumitw/pi-tui-kit@0.58.0

## 0.53.0

### Minor Changes

- c194597: Make conversation-history-only implementation the default, use Codex-style kickoff prompts without active-plan injection, and clarify Plan reinjection controls.
- e74ee84: Add configurable Plan helper visibility and default to revealing the helper tools on the first successful Plan activation.
- 67eb77b: Remove the `--plan` startup flag. Start Plan mode after launch with `/plan start` or begin with a prompt through `/plan <prompt>`.
- da265a0: Keep Plan and Normal requests on one append-only conversation with stable tool schemas, versioned mode contracts, and a runtime Plan tool allowlist that no longer activates inactive tools.

### Patch Changes

- df584db: Keep unused resumed sessions free of mode contracts and reject `/tree` navigation to internal transition markers.
- 5be9aa2: Prevent active agent runs from mixing Plan and Normal tool contracts, and retry explicit structured finalization once after settlement when the model responds with prose only.

## 0.52.0

### Minor Changes

- 85d13c8: Coordinate Plan-mode activation through Workflow Mutex Protocol v1 so cooperating agent workflows cannot start in the same Pi session.

## 0.51.1

### Patch Changes

- 8540d0f: Simplify single-question TUI questionnaires with a plain header and immediate answer submission while retaining tabbed Review for multiple questions.
- 5785cb4: Reuse Pi TUI Kit's questionnaire runner while preserving Plan mode answer and lifecycle behavior.
- Updated dependencies [8540d0f]
  - @narumitw/pi-tui-kit@0.57.1

## 0.51.0

### Minor Changes

- 416da47: Add tabbed TUI Plan questions with answer notes and final review.

## 0.50.1

### Patch Changes

- 30bc076: Load each extension from a generated TypeScript runtime to reduce Jiti package startup work while preserving existing first-use boundaries.

## 0.50.0

### Minor Changes

- 160f2fc: Add an optional `toggleShortcut` setting and a **Plan mode shortcut** Settings row so the global Plan-mode keybinding can be chosen, and keep it disabled while the setting is omitted. Reload the settings file automatically when it changes and rebind the configured shortcut immediately after a Settings save.
