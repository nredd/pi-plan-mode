# @nredd/pi-plan-mode

## 0.58.3-nredd.4

Targets Pi 1.0.0 (`devDependencies` move from 0.86.0 to 1.0.0).

### Changed

- Escape in the ready-plan chooser now keeps the plan and stays in Plan mode
  (it discarded the plan in nredd.1 to nredd.3). Ctrl+C closes the chooser with
  no action. Only `Discard plan and exit` discards.
- `plan_mode_question` and `plan_mode_complete` render for Pi 1.0's one-line
  collapsed rows: a meaningful first line from `renderCall` and `renderResult`
  (`plan question · Scope · Scope → Small`, `cancelled (reason)`, and
  `<title> · plan proposed`), with the full content when expanded.
- A `safeSubcommands` prefix now approves only its own command segment; other
  segments of a `&&`/`||`/`;`/`|` list are validated independently. Redirections,
  `$(...)` in double quotes, and pipes into interpreters are rejected even for
  configured prefixes. Prefixes match on whitespace/end or when they end in a
  non-alphanumeric character.
- `git -C <dir>` is allowed under the working directory or a trusted directory.
- The fork now builds and tests standalone: vendored `runtime-builder`, test
  harness, `biome.json` and `vitest.config.ts`; `npm test` runs vitest.

### Added

- Decline gate. Escape/Stay on a ready plan, or a reply while a plan awaits
  action, counts as a decline (`declinedPlans`, persisted, reset on a new
  workflow or exit). After a decline `plan_mode_complete` errors until a
  `plan_mode_question` is answered or `/plan finalize` runs. The model gets a
  decline contract (1 decline: restate, re-verify, ask; 2 or more: list threads
  as resolved/open and wait for an explicit go-ahead). The "resubmit the
  unchanged plan" rule is removed.
- `cd <dir>` in limited `bash` (single plain path under the cwd or a trusted
  directory; moves the effective directory for later segments).
- `trustedDirectories` setting (global settings only) for `cd` and `git -C`.
- `ssh <host> <cmd>` for a configured `ssh <host>` prefix, with the remote command
  re-validated recursively.
- `gh api` (GET only) and `curl` (no output, data, or upload flags, GET only).

## 0.58.3-nredd.3

### Fixed

- Allow `-i` (ignore case) for `rg`, `grep`, `egrep`, `fgrep` and `git` in the
  reviewed shell policy. It was rejected for every command because `sed -i`
  edits in place, which is still blocked.

## 0.58.3-nredd.2

### Fixed

- Deflaked the `default-tools` watched-reload test by re-saving settings until
  the reload lands; macOS FSEvents can drop a write made during watch startup.

## 0.58.3-nredd.1

### Changed

- Rebased the fork onto upstream 0.58.3 as a patch queue. `package.json` keeps
  upstream's name and version; `dist/` is built in the upstream monorepo and
  committed last.
- Escape in the ready-plan chooser now discards the plan and exits Plan mode
  instead of only dismissing the chooser.

## 0.58.0-nredd.5

### Changed

- Restored once-only automatic ready-plan approval after a valid completion
  settles idle with no queued messages. Cancellation, incomplete prose,
  reload, supersession, exit, and session replacement do not open it.
- Replaced the verbose ready-plan selector with responsive, keyboard- and
  mouse-operable action cells. The fullscreen chooser has no policy,
  reinjection, or per-action description text; RPC keeps a description-free
  selector fallback.

## 0.58.0-nredd.4

### Changed

- Kept the transcript scrollable after plan completion by leaving the ready-plan
  action menu closed until the user runs `/plan`. The compact `plan ready`
  footer and one-line widget remain visible while review is pending.

## 0.58.0-nredd.3

### Changed

- Removed the above-editor widget for the "implementing" state (`Implementing
  plan — /plan to show, replace, or clear`) -- redundant with the
  `plan implementing` footer status chip added in 0.58.0-nredd.2
  (`presentation.ts`).
- `plan ready` and `plan saved` are unaffected and keep their one-line widget.

## 0.58.0-nredd.2

### Changed

- Removed the above-editor widget entirely for plain "planning" state (Plan
  mode on, no plan ready yet). The footer status chip (`plan active`) is now
  colored with the theme's `accent` role, Codex-style, instead of plain text
  (`presentation.ts`).
- States with a concrete pending action (`plan ready`, `plan saved`,
  `plan implementing`) are unaffected and keep their one-line widget.

## 0.58.0-nredd.1

Fork of `@narumitw/pi-plan-mode` 0.58.0, extracted to a standalone repo.

### Changed

- Shrank the always-on Plan-mode widget to one line instead of a three-line
  tool-policy dump (`presentation.ts`).
- Added `renderResult` to the `plan_mode_question` tool so answers render as
  Markdown instead of a raw JSON dump, matching `plan_mode_complete`
  (`question-tool.ts`, `plan-mode.ts`).

# @narumitw/pi-plan-mode

## 0.59.2

### Patch Changes

- 2708319: Require Pi TUI Kit's published questionnaire custom-editor fix so existing lockfiles cannot retain a Kit release that bypasses the configured editor factory or mishandles editor submissions and key-release cycles.

## 0.59.1

### Patch Changes

- 000bd50: Use Pi's publicly configured custom editor factory for TUI questionnaire answers and notes. Custom editors own editing and submission keys, while Ctrl+C remains hard cancellation and the main prompt editor stays untouched. Preserve raw expanded drafts, fragmented paste safety, default-editor and non-TUI behavior, and release questionnaire-owned editor instances when the interaction ends.
  
  Honor custom editor submission values without replacing intentional normalization with the original draft, and retain editor-owned key-release cycles across answer and note transitions.
- Updated dependencies [000bd50]
  - @narumitw/pi-tui-kit@0.65.2

## 0.59.0

### Minor Changes

- 51d8c21: Restrict `safeSubcommands` trust to individual parsed Bash and PowerShell segments. A matching prefix no longer exempts trailing commands or bypasses the shell parser: every segment must pass its own policy, and unsupported syntax such as redirects and multiline input remains blocked.
  
  This is a compatibility change from full-command trust. Simple configured commands and trusted arguments remain supported, but chains require each additional segment to be independently permitted. Run workflows requiring parser-unsupported syntax outside Plan mode after review. The settings schema is unchanged, and explicitly trusted commands and their arguments can still mutate data or execute code; this setting is not a read-only guarantee or sandbox.

## 0.58.4

### Patch Changes

- 9621cda: Distinguish inactive Pi tools from Plan-policy blocks in Settings and the pre-start picker, and explain how to enable built-in search tools through Pi settings without changing tool activation or execution policy.
- dbc6e8e: Allow explicit selection of native MCP and orchestration tools in Plan Mode. Honor registered callable exposure without direct activation while preserving automatic core defaults, frozen workflow policies, and per-call nested safety checks.
- acb3aaf: Allow case-insensitive inspection flags such as `rg -i` and `grep -i` in the Plan mode shell policy.

## 0.58.3

### Patch Changes

- 26e8801: Make Plan-mode shortcut changes explicitly take effect after `/reload` or restarting Pi. Keep startup shortcut registrations stable, remove ineffective live rebinding, and show the configured and startup-loaded values with reload guidance in Settings. Other settings retain their existing reload behavior.
- Updated dependencies [e6db042]
  - @narumitw/pi-tui-kit@0.65.1

## 0.58.2

### Patch Changes

- 8abd5b7: Keep generated extension runtime graphs inside Pi's Jiti-loaded TypeScript path to avoid duplicate peer-runtime evaluation during startup. Add measured generated runtimes for Context Management, Herdr, and TypeSafe Search.

## 0.58.1

### Patch Changes

- 67a3049: Adapt provider, transcript, usage, deferred-tool, and telemetry behavior to Pi's current runtime contracts, including accurate cache-warming accounting and exclusion from ordinary generation traces.

## 0.58.0

### Minor Changes

- b745330: Add persistent fresh implementation model and thinking defaults with a same-as-plan fallback.
- 0ef037d: Add one-shot model and thinking selection before fresh ready-plan implementation.

### Patch Changes

- 7c9a062: Defer automatic ready-plan fresh session handoffs until lifecycle dispatch and prompt cleanup finish.
- Updated dependencies [4485b49]
- Updated dependencies [6b1e009]
  - @narumitw/pi-tui-kit@0.62.0

## 0.57.1

### Patch Changes

- 31b3dde: Remove the implementation model and thinking selectors, restoring Plan implementation handoffs to the current model and normal thinking behavior.

## 0.57.0

### Minor Changes

- e2af16b: Add optional implementation model and thinking defaults plus per-menu implementation options for same-session and fresh-session handoffs. Apply choices only at implementation start without changing Pi defaults or automatically restoring the planner's model after a run ends.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [317f7bd]
  - @narumitw/pi-tui-kit@0.61.0

## 0.56.0

### Minor Changes

- e230348: Allow narrowly validated local `hostname`, `tasklist`, `Get-Process`, and `Get-Service` inspections in Plan mode by default.
- 708cc2e: Let users add arbitrary `safeSubcommands` entries and treat every configured command-subcommand prefix as fully trusted for Plan-mode Bash and PowerShell calls.

## 0.55.3

### Patch Changes

- 14068d2: Allow reviewed Git inspections to use current-working-directory `git -C <path>` forms, and report actionable reasons when Plan mode denies an unavailable, inactive, frozen, blocked, or unselected tool.

## 0.55.2

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [40182e5]
  - @narumitw/pi-tui-kit@0.59.0

## 0.55.1

### Patch Changes

- b99b3db: Resolve explicitly selected tools registered before the first Plan request without mutating Pi's active tool schemas.

## 0.55.0

### Minor Changes

- b59cdbc: Remove the `toolVisibility` setting and keep Plan helper schemas stable from startup.
  Retired settings keys are ignored and preserved, while globally visible helper metadata now distinguishes `/plan` from ordinary planning workflows.

## 0.54.0

### Minor Changes

- ab467e0: Allow Pi's active native PowerShell tool to run reviewed read-only file, directory, Git, and GitHub inspections in Plan mode while blocking mutation and unsupported dynamic syntax.

## 0.53.1

### Patch Changes

- 02878f5: Add an editor-style divider above the Plan mode widget.
- 3346683: Publish generated lazy chunks at the JavaScript paths referenced by each extension runtime so deferred menus and implementations load correctly through Pi's Jiti loader.
- Updated dependencies [b9eba3a]
  - @narumitw/pi-tui-kit@0.58.0

## 0.53.0

### Minor Changes

- c194597: Make conversation-history-only implementation the default, use Codex-style kickoff prompts without active-plan injection, and clarify Plan reinjection controls.
- e74ee84: Add configurable Plan helper visibility and default to revealing the helper tools on the first successful Plan activation.
- 67eb77b: Remove the `--plan` startup flag. Start Plan mode after launch with `/plan start` or begin with a prompt through `/plan <prompt>`.
- da265a0: Keep Plan and Normal requests on one append-only conversation with stable tool schemas, versioned mode contracts, and a runtime Plan tool allowlist that no longer activates inactive tools.

### Patch Changes

- df584db: Keep unused resumed sessions free of mode contracts and reject `/tree` navigation to internal transition markers.
- 5be9aa2: Prevent active agent runs from mixing Plan and Normal tool contracts, and retry explicit structured finalization once after settlement when the model responds with prose only.

## 0.52.0

### Minor Changes

- 85d13c8: Coordinate Plan-mode activation through Workflow Mutex Protocol v1 so cooperating agent workflows cannot start in the same Pi session.

## 0.51.1

### Patch Changes

- 8540d0f: Simplify single-question TUI questionnaires with a plain header and immediate answer submission while retaining tabbed Review for multiple questions.
- 5785cb4: Reuse Pi TUI Kit's questionnaire runner while preserving Plan mode answer and lifecycle behavior.
- Updated dependencies [8540d0f]
  - @narumitw/pi-tui-kit@0.57.1

## 0.51.0

### Minor Changes

- 416da47: Add tabbed TUI Plan questions with answer notes and final review.

## 0.50.1

### Patch Changes

- 30bc076: Load each extension from a generated TypeScript runtime to reduce Jiti package startup work while preserving existing first-use boundaries.

## 0.50.0

### Minor Changes

- 160f2fc: Add an optional `toggleShortcut` setting and a **Plan mode shortcut** Settings row so the global Plan-mode keybinding can be chosen, and keep it disabled while the setting is omitted. Reload the settings file automatically when it changes and rebind the configured shortcut immediately after a Settings save.
